# qr-vcard
An Electron app to locally create QR VCards

## Intention

Ever bothered creating a QRCode VRCard? You will find dozens of websites offering you services to create a QRCode VRCard. Just enter your contact data on these pages and you will get your personal VRCard as a QRCode.

But what happens with your supplied personal contact data? Is it saved by the company or person running the website? Is it then sold to spammers? You cannot tell!

Creating your codes on your own, local machine is the solution; and this little project can help you in this case.

## Starting

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the repository directory
3. Run `npm start`
4. Enjoy :)
